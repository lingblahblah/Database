### Descriptions
The “Columbia University Database System” is designed to keep track of the information of the 
Schools, Departments, Staffs, Courses, Students (both current and graduated), and Company. 
Our project aims to provide users a front-end access to a specific school (Columbia University) database. 
Users will be able to identify entities such as School, Staff, Student, Department and Courses, 
as well as the relationships among entities. 
Users will also be able to select from some drop down menus to generate queries.
