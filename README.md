### Descriptions
The “Columbia University Database System” is designed to keep track of the information of the 
Schools, Departments, Staffs, Courses, Students (both current and graduated), and Company. 
Our project aims to provide users a front-end access to a specific school (Columbia University) database. 
Users will be able to identify entities such as School, Staff, Student, Department and Courses, 
as well as the relationships among entities. 
Users will also be able to select from some drop down menus to generate queries. 

-- Something we have not accomplished: Dropdown menu to generate queries

We think all of our two webpages that are very interesting because one contains all the information about the dataset, and the other one will simply need use to click the button in order to run the database operations. It's user friendly and the interfaces look very pretty too.
